# Autoencoder for 1D and 2D diffraction phase mapping

Code repository for unsupervised phase clustering from 2D and 1D mapping diffraction data using encoder-decoder-CNN and clustering in latent space.
Use the `.ipynb` file and load it on GoogleColab to get an interactive UI to interact with the autoencoder.

Inspired from [Versatile domain mapping of scanning electron nanobeam diffraction datasets utilising variational autoencoders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00960-y).
Model training adapted from Po-Yen Tung's [EDX autoencoder work](https://github.com/poyentung/sigma).
